# FAQ

### Why should I use the Utility over the official app?
Currently, the utility has features such as sample pre-buffering,
shutdown behaviours, remote config, multi device support, an API,
a better stream deck plugin and a command line interface for scripts and such.
Unlike the official app, the Utility is also in active development.
In the future we will be investigating additional features, such as fader paging and multiple mute targets.

### Can you add feature X?
Features we can add are limited by the firmware and drivers available.
This means we cannot change how the audio sounds, add any additional EQ settings, add output channels etc.

### Will the Firmware/Driver continue to receive updates ?
There will be no further firmware/driver updates for the near future,
because they can only be updated by TC-Helicon.

### How can I use GoXLR/GoXLR Mini with a USB headset or wireless headset without a 3.5mm input ?
GoXLR works best with a pair of analog headphones. The best players in the world have largely cashed in their gaming
headsets for a pair of great headphones. We highly encourage everyone to use a pair of 3.5mm (or adapt 6.5mm)
headphones with GoXLR. However, if your circumstance dictates that you want to/need to use USB headphones,
there are some workarounds.

Please note that these workarounds will not yield 1:1 results with analog headphones. You will have higher latency.
You will likely have to reset your Windows volume settings from time to time. This is out of our control.

#### Here's how:
- Purchase a Ground Loop Isolator and 3.5mm cable.
- From the headphone jack of GoXLR, connect the 3.5mm cable and ground loop isolator into the Line In on your PC. Make sure the ground loop isolator is on the Line In side of the 3.5mm cable and not the GoXLR side.
- Go to the Sound Control Panel by searching for "Change System Sounds" in your taskbar.
- Click on the Recording Tab.
- Right click on the Line In (make sure to check disabled devices) and click on Properties > Listen Tab.
- Choose "Listen to this device."
- In the dropdown list under the checkbox, select your USB headset.
