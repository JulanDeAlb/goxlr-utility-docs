# FAQ

### Why should I use the Utility over the official app?
Currently, the utility has features such as sample pre-buffering,
shutdown behaviours, remote config, multi device support, an API,
a better stream deck plugin and a command line interface for scripts and such.
Unlike the official app, the Utility is also in active development.
In the future we will be investigating additional features, such as fader paging and multiple mute targets.

### Can you add feature X?
Features we can add are limited by the firmware and drivers available.
This means we cannot change how the audio sounds, add any additional EQ settings, add output channels etc.

### Will the Firmware/Driver continue to receive updates ?
There will be no further firmware/driver updates for the near future,
because they can only be updated by TC-Helicon.
